# Apollo Router

In order to spin up the router, you'll need to:

1) download the router via NPM script: `npm run download:router`
2) create a supergraph file by composing the subgraph schemas locally: `npm run rover:compose`
3) start the router with the customer config and the newly composed supergraph file: `npm run start`
